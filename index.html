  <h1>Python</h1>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=f_ntk0Rk0A4CPC7X">Python</a> is a
    high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
    <strong>code readability</strong> with the use of significant indentation.
  </p>

  <p>Python is <strong>dynamically typed</strong> and
    <strong>garbage-collected</strong>. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
    including <strong>structured</strong> (particularly procedural),
    <strong>object-oriented</strong> and <strong>functional programming</strong>. It is
    often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
    library.

  <p><strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> began working on Python in the late 1980s as a
    successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python
    0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major
    revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18,
    released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.</p>

  <p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</p>
